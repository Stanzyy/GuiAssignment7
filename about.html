    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Nicolas Stanzione and I
        am currently a Senior in Computer Science at UMass Lowell.
        Once I finish up my Bachelors here I will be enrolled in an
        additional year of graduate school pursuing my Master's degree 
        in Computer Science at UML.

<div id='Cat'>
    <p>
        Fun fact about me is that I love cats! The kitten on the page is
        my buddy Spencer! He can be a handful at times but most of the 
        time he is just adorable.
    </p>
